Gone-Fishin-Game
================

Overview: Fun desktop game where user competes against computer to survive and thrive as a fish.

Design: This game was designed and created by Ryan Smith and Anders Schneider. 

Use: 
1- Move the red user-fish by moving the mouse or your finger on the trackpad.
2- Collide with smaller fish in order to eat and grow.
3- Do not collide with larger fish or they will eat you and the game will end. The fish will enter from the right and left sides of the screen. They will be random sizes and travel at random speeds (within reason). *Hint - they swim in a straight line across the screen.
4- You will achieve a score based on the size and quantity of the food you eat.
5- Avoid sharks (black fish with a fin) at all costs! They will eat you and end the game even if you are bigger (they're sharks afterall...) *Hint - keep an eye out. Sharks are slower than you but will continue to pursue you across the screen. If you move quickly you can corral them. 

Other Info: This program is written in the Processing programming language which provides an IDE useful for working on small projects involving basic graphics.

The program can be launched from any of the files within.
